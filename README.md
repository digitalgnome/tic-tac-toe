# [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/digitalgnome/tic-tac-toe)

This is some Tic-Tac-Toe Primer Code for AshlandJS Meetup.  Currently, the game is incomplete, i.e., the game's logic lacks offensive capabilities, and only has defensive blocking code.

Admittedly, the current code is a brute force approach that totally breaks the precepts of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.  In the future I will try to add a more elegant coding solution, as well as the offensive logic to the program.
